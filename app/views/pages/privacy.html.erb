<p>

Like most website operators, 42Zen, LLC collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 42Zen, LLC’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how 42Zen, LLC’s visitors use its website. From time to time, 42Zen, LLC may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

42Zen, LLC also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 42Zen, LLC does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
